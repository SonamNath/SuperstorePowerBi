# SuperstorePowerBi
This project involves the analysis and visualization of sales data from the Superstore dataset, which was imported from Kaggle. The primary goal is to gain insights into the sales performance of the Superstore and create an interactive Power BI dashboard for business stakeholders.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the Superstore Sales dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information about sales transactions, including order date, customer details, product details, sales region, and more.


# Objectives:

Data Preparation: Import and clean the Superstore dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, data type conversions, and any necessary data transformations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics. Explore key metrics such as sales revenue, profit, and quantity sold. Identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.

Visualizations: Create a variety of visualizations, including but not limited to bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps, to effectively communicate insights from the data. Visualizations should be interactive and customizable within the Power BI dashboard.

Page Navigators: Develop two buttons for better interaction which helps user to redirect to their desirable page of the report.

Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that brings together the EDA findings, visualizations, and KPIs. Ensure that the dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for business users to explore the data and make data-driven decisions.

Insights and Recommendations: Summarize the insights gained from the analysis and present actionable recommendations for improving sales and profitability. These recommendations should be based on data-driven insights derived from the Superstore dataset.

Documentation: Create documentation that includes data preprocessing steps, EDA findings, visualization choices, and the rationale behind KPI selection. This documentation will be useful for sharing insights with stakeholders and for future reference.

# Tools and Technologies:
